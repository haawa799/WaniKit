/**
    The delegate of an `AppleAppleOperationQueue` can respond to `AppleOperation` lifecycle
    events by implementing these methods.

    In general, implementing `AppleAppleOperationQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
    want to use an `AppleOperationObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
    situations where using `AppleAppleOperationQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
    For example, `GroupAppleOperation` is the delegate of its own internal
    `AppleAppleOperationQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
